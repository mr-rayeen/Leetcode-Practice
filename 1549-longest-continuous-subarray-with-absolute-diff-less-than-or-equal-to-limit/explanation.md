# Explanation of the Code Approach 1: Sliding Window and heap

## Heaps Initialization
Two heaps, `maxPq` and `minPq`, are initialized to store elements and their indices. The max heap is used to keep track of the maximum elements encountered so far within the window, while the min heap is used similarly for the minimum elements.

## Sliding Window
The solution maintains a sliding window represented by indices `i` and `j`. Initially, `i` is set to 0, and `j` is set to 0, indicating that the window starts at the beginning of the array.

## Window Expansion
As `j` slides through the array, elements are pushed onto both heaps. If the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the window exceeds the limit, the window is contracted from the left by adjusting `i`.

## Contracting the Window
To contract the window, elements outside the new window bounds are popped from both heaps. This ensures that the heaps only contain elements within the current window.

## Updating maxLength
After adjusting the window, `maxLength` is updated if the current window is longer than any previously seen valid window.

## Loop Termination
The loop continues until `j` reaches the end of the array, ensuring that all possible windows have been considered.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \log n)\). This is because each insertion and removal operation on a heap takes \(O(\log n)\) time, and in the worst case, every element might be inserted and removed once from the heaps. Therefore, the total time complexity is proportional to the number of operations, which is linear in the size of the input array.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\). This is due to the storage required for the heaps, which in the worst case, might store all elements of the array. Additionally, the sliding window mechanism requires space to store the indices of the elements, contributing to the linear space complexity.
